## 🎯 Current Hygraph Schema

Based on API calls, the current schema includes:
```graphql
type Category {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  icon: Asset
  bgcolor: Color
}

type BusinessList {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  about: String
  address: String
  email: String
  contactPerson: String
  category: Category
  images: [Asset]
}

type Booking {
  id: ID!
  date: String!
  time: String!
  userEmail: String!
  userName: String!
  businessList: BusinessList
  bookingStatus: BookingStatus
}
```

## 🔗 Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MASTER_URL_KEY=<Hygraph API Key>
DESCOPE_API=<Descope Project ID>
DESCOPE_CLIENT_ID=<Descope Client ID>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<NextAuth Secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=<App URL>
```

## 🚨 Critical Technical Debt
1. **Delete booking functionality** - Currently has placeholder implementation
2. **Error handling** - Missing comprehensive error handling
3. **Loading states** - Inconsistent loading UI
4. **Type safety** - No TypeScript, potential runtime errors
5. **Testing** - No test suite established
6. **SEO** - Missing meta tags and SSR optimization

## 📊 Code Quality Assessment
- **Good**: Clean component structure, consistent naming
- **Good**: Proper separation of concerns (components, services, routes)
- **Needs Improvement**: Error handling, loading states
- **Needs Improvement**: Type safety (consider TypeScript migration)
- **Missing**: Testing infrastructure, documentation

## 🎯 Next Immediate Priorities
1. Complete Phase 2 missing features
2. Set up MongoDB for enhanced data management
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add loading states and user feedback
5. Begin real-time features preparation
